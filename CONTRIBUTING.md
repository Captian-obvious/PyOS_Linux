<h1>I will allow contributions, Howver they will be reviewed</h1>
<h2>There are a few things you may not request to change, for example:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>You may not tell me to remove the python theme, You can ask for it to be changed though.</li>
    <li>You are not permitted to suggest changes to the base kernel this will use, Im sorry, but this is a Linux distro not a BSD distro.</li>
</ul>
<h2>There are things I WOULD like suggestions on</h2>
<ul>
    <li>You may suggest a 32 bit version of the system.</li>
    <li>You can suggest additional themes to add to the Python Centric environment</li>
    <li>You may suggest additional software to be added to the distro (I am not a total monster)</li>
    <li>You can suggest different base distros if you dont prefer Kubuntu</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Remember to keep your suggestions within guidelines,<br>
    as this Operating System will likely end up used by young ones as well as adults.<br>
    There is a learning application included in the base ISO,<br>
    You may use it to learn python if you do not know how to program.<br>
    <em>Also, dont forget to be polite!</em>
